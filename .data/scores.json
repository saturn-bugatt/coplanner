Built with vanilla JavaScript and Bulma CSS, it features sophisticated time-based calculations, URL-parameter configuration, and responsive design with smooth real-time updates.",
        "judgeFeedback": "Great work on creating a polished, mathematically sound passive income visualizer! Your implementation shows excellent software engineering practices with clean code organization and comprehensive calculations. The real-time updates and granular time breakdowns create an engaging user experience. To take this further, consider adding data persistence, integration with real financial APIs, comparison tools between different investment scenarios, and perhaps gamification elements to make financial planning more engaging. The foundation you've built is solid and could evolve into a powerful financial planning tool."
